# Project Architecture & Rules

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4)
- **Database / Backend**: Supabase (Database, Auth, Row Level Security)
- **Scraper**: Playwright + Stealth Plugin (headless Chromium with bot protection bypass)
- **Notifications**: Twilio (WhatsApp notifications API)

## Database Schema (Supabase)
- `listings`: Stores scraped real estate listings. Uses `external_id` (Njuškalo ID) for deduplication.
- `scrape_runs`: Logs scraper execution history, status, and listing counts.

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/             # Next.js App Router pages & API routes
├── components/      # React components (Dashboard, ui/)
└── lib/             # Business logic (supabase/, scraper/, notifications/)
```

## Architecture Notes
- Use Next.js Server Components for initial page render of listings.
- Wrap API clients (e.g. Supabase, Twilio) inside handler/endpoint functions or utilize lazy initialization to prevent Next.js build-time errors from missing environment variables.
- Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables created in Supabase.
- Supabase server client uses service role key (bypasses RLS) for scraper writes.
- Supabase browser client uses anon key for public reads.
- Without generated database types, use `any` casts on Supabase write operations.
- All UI text is in Croatian (hr).
